Graph theory has found a number of applications in physics research. Condensed matter research in particular has found a number of uses for graph theoretical work, but it has also been applied in statistical physics, astrophysics, and other subfields.

# Condensed Matter
Graph theory has found a wide number of applications in condensed matter research. One such application is the study of tight-binding Hamiltonians, used in the study of molecular systems and solids. The tight-binding approach reduces the complexity of the system by neglecting the electron-electron interactions that take place. With a couple of reasonable approximations, the Hamiltonian becomes $\textbf{H}=\alpha \textbf{I} + \beta \textbf{A}$ where $\textbf{I}$ is the identity matrix and $\textbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix of the graph that describes the "carbon skeleton" structure of the molecule, i.e. which carbon atoms are bound to each other. This means that all the interesting properties contained in the Hamiltonian can be extracted by studying the spectrum of the graph, which in graph theory refers to the eigenvalues and multiplicities of the graph. There has been a great deal of research done in the graph theory community on the spectra of graphs, which can be used to extract and interpret this information. The nullity - the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue - of these graphs has also been connected to the electron shell configurations of certain classes of molecules.
# Particle Physics
Graphs have been used to approximately analyze the path integrals found in quantum field theory. Feynmann diagrams are a visualization of particle interactions on a quantum scale, and can be represented and studied as graphs. A number of interesting properties have been extracted from this type of study.

# Astrophysics and Cosmology
Of particular interest to me is the application of graph theory in astrophysics, as my research falls under that subfield. No one has yet applied graph theory specifically to the physics of proto-neutron stars, as the topic is focused on time evolution which does not translate well into graphs. Graph theory has been applied to studies of the structure of the universe, specifically the clustering of galaxies that we observe. Researchers Uedo and Itoh in Japan created nearest-neighbor graphs of galaxies from cosmological N-body simulations and analyzed 4 different properties of those graphs to determine which properties could be used to distinguish galaxy distributions from simulations that used different evolution models. They explored the number of the graphs, the edge-length distribution function of the graphs, the distribution function of the order and degree of the graphs, and the distribution function of the eigenvalue of the graphs. They found that the first three properties did not distinguish well between the different models they used, but the eigenvalue distribution of the graphs did provide a way to distinguish between different evolution models. They also explored separated minimal spanning trees and group graphs created from these simulations, and found other useful properties. A similar graph theoretical analysis could be applied to observational data, and these properties can be used to evaluate the performance of different theoretical models of cosmological evolution.
